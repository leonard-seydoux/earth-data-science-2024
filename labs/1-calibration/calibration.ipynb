    "Estimating the suspended load within a river is a key issue in geomorphology. The suspended load is often estimated by sampling the water column and measuring the concentration $C_S$ of suspended particles. Although this method is accurate, it is not suitable for long-term monitoring, since it is time-consuming and expensive. A cheaper and faster method is to use turbidity probes. \n",

However, the relationship between turbidity and suspended load is not straightforward. It depends on the size and the shape of the particles. The goal of this notebook is to calibrate a turbidity probe placed in a river against independent measurements of suspended load. In other terms, we want to find a relationship between the turbidity and the suspended load. And for this, we will use a machine-learning approach.\n",
